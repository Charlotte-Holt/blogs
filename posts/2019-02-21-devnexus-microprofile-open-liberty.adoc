= MicroProfile and Open Liberty at DevNexus 2019 in Atlanta
Laura Cowen <https://github.com/lauracowen>

Several of the Open Liberty team will be at https://devnexus.com/[DevNexus 2019] in Atlanta on 6-8 March. If you're also going to be there, deciding which of the great talks to see at DevNexus looks like it could be a challenge. So here's a quick summary of the sessions on https://openliberty.io/about/[Open Liberty] and https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile].

== Workshops at DevNexus 2019

If you're attending the workshop day on Wednesday:

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3170/[Hands-on cloud-native Java with MicroProfile, Kubernetes and Istio]
+
https://twitter.com/gcharters[Graham Charters] and https://twitter.com/emilyfhjiang[Emily Jiang] will lead this workshop on what it means to be cloud-native and how that impacts application development. They'll introduce you to https://microprofile.io/[Eclipse MicroProfile] and help you to either get started with the basics of REST services or to jump right in and develop secure, fault tolerant, configurable, and monitorable microservices. They'll then show you how to package and deploy your app in Docker containers in a Kubernetes cluster.

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3560/[Java application security the hard way]
+
OpenJ9's https://twitter.com/spoole167[Steve Poole] will team up with Snyk Director of Developer Relations https://twitter.com/sjmaple[Simon Maple] to lead this fun session on how to build your "security memory muscle" and help you learn how to make your Java apps more secure.

== Talks at DevNexus 2019

A selection of MicroProfile and Open Liberty talks on Thursday and Friday:

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3165/[Are you ready for cloud-native Java?]
+
OpenJ9's https://twitter.com/spoole167[Steve Poole] and Open Liberty's https://twitter.com/gcharters[Graham Charters] will talk you through the concept of developing cloud-native Java applications. Find out more about what cloud-native Java looks like and how it can differ from expectations. Steve and Graham will point out what to be aware of and which open technologies can help you.

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3921/[Open Liberty: A Modern Java Platform for the Cloud]
+
Open Liberty's https://twitter.com/nottycode[Alasdair Nottingham] will consider the requirements of Java platforms in the cloud and how Java application servers have evolved to be more efficient and effective. Open Liberty is one such project and Alasdair will guide you through using Open Liberty to build modern applications using Java EE, Eclipse MicroProfile, or Spring.

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3296/[MicroProfile and Jakarta EE - What's Next?]
+
MicroProfile and Open Liberty's https://twitter.com/kwsutter[Kevin Sutter] will look into the future of the MicroProfile and Jakarta EE projects, answering common questions such as "What's next for each project?" and "Will MicroProfile and Jakartaa EE merge or stay separate?". If you want to know the answers, this is where you'll get Kevin's current view on it all.

* https://devnexus.com/presentations/3271/[A Java Space Odyssey: Fun with flying saucers, lasers, Pis and Arduino]
