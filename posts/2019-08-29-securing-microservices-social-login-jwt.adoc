= Securing Open Liberty apps and microservices with MicroProfile JWT and Social Media login
Bruce Tiffany <https://github.com/brutif>

Open Liberty now includes more security features to enable you to secure your apps with external security providers. Let's take a quick look at why and how to use some of these features.

== Delegating authentication
Delegating user authentication to an external security provider can offer several advantages: it ensures that the secured app never sees the user's password; it relieves developers and administrators of the effort of managing user accounts; it can provide a single sign-on experience to users that enables them to log in once for all secured apps that they use.

Open Liberty provides the link:/docs/ref/feature/#socialLogin-1.0.html[Social Media Login (`socialLogin-1.0`) feature] which developers can use to delegate authentication to external providers. App users can log in using their existing social media credentials from providers such as Facebook, Twitter, GitHub, and others. App developers can also customize configurations for other social media providers that are not included by default. App developers just need to register the app with one or more of these providers and add a few lines to `server.xml` to secure the app. The Social Media Login feature is an link:https://openid.net/connect/[OpenID Connect] client (largely based on the link:/docs/ref/feature/#jdbc-4.3.html[`openidConnectClient-1.0` feature] which can alternatively be used), and is certified by the link:https://openid.net/foundation/[OpenID Foundation] as a Basic RP (Relying Party; an app that uses an external identity provider for authentication).

Open Liberty also supplies the link:/docs/ref/feature/#samlWeb-2.0.html[`samlWeb-2.0` feature] for authenticating with a SAML security provider, and the link:/docs/ref/feature/#spnego-1.0.html[`spnego-1.0` feature]
for authenticating with Microsoft Active Directory. 

== Consuming JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
Developers can use the link:/docs/ref/feature/#mpJwt-1.1.html[MicroProfile JWT (`mpjwt-1.1`) feature] to secure microservices.  link:https://jwt.io[JSON web tokens] (JWTs) are identity credentials with a standardized format that can be exchanged between processes. They're secured against tampering by use of digital signatures.  These tokens can be submitted to secured microservices to propagate the identity of a logged-in user in an efficient, self-contained way.  

Developers can write apps that consume JWTs from an external provider, or they can build and consume their own JWTs using an API with the link:/docs/ref/feature/#jwt-1.0.html[JWT (`jwt-1.0`) feature]. This enables them to build JWTs for use with microservices. 

== Configuring Open Liberty as a provider
It is also possible to configure Open Liberty as an OpenID Connect provider. The link:/docs/ref/feature/#openidConnectServer-1.0.html[OpenID Connect Provider (`openidConnectServer-1.0`) feature] can be configured to manage user authentication and to issue JWTs for use by OpenID Connect clients and microservices. The OpenID Connect Provider can work directly with a user registry such as LDAP or act as an identity broker and delegate to another security provider.

//

== Example: Using OpenID Connect and JWTs to authenticate users and secure microservices:

The following sample code and configurations show two web applications to demonstrate authenticating a user, building a JWT and accessing a secured microservice using that JWT. The pieces of this are:

* A servlet app secured with OpenID Connect is hosted on an Open Liberty server called `oidc_client`. The server is configured with the Social Media Login feature (`socialLogin-1.0`), with Google as the designated security provider. 
+
* A JAX-RS microservice that is secured with MicroProfile JWT is hosted on a server called `microservice`.  The server is configured with the MicroProfile JWT feature (`mpJwt-1.1`).

An application is first registered with Google, which then supplies the client ID and client secret used in the `server.xml` (for registration instructions, see link:https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2[Google's developer docs]).

The public certificate from Google is added to the client, and certificates exchanged between client and microservice (for more information, see the link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEQTP_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.wlp.doc/ae/twlp_add_trust_cert.html[WebSphere Liberty Knowledge Center]).

When a user attempts to access the servlet, their browser is redirected to Google for them to enter their ID and password.  Upon success, the browser gets redirected back to the client with an authorization code.  The client then contacts the provider (Google) on a back channel, obtains an access token, then uses it to create an authenticated user on the client, which then gets access to the servlet.

The servlet running on `oidc_client` then creates a JWT and makes a REST call to the microservice running on `microservice`.  The JWT gets sent along in an HTTP header. The `microservice` server is configured to trust JWTs issued by `oidc_client`, so it grants access to the JAX-RS service.

Requesting servlet:
[source,java]
----
@WebServlet("/")
@ServletSecurity(value = @HttpConstraint(rolesAllowed= {"users"}))
public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {
    
    public MyServlet() {
        super();       
    }

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        PrintWriter pw = response.getWriter();
        Principal principal = request.getUserPrincipal();
        String jwt = null;
        if (principal != null && principal.getName() != null) {
            try {
                jwt = buildJwt(principal.getName());  // build our own JWT to propagate downstream
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }      
        javax.ws.rs.client.ClientBuilder cb = ClientBuilder.newBuilder();
        pw.append("Calling the jaxrs service and sending jwt...\n");
        javax.ws.rs.client.Client c = cb.build();
        String res = null;
        try {
            res = c.target("https://localhost:39443/jaxrshello")          
            .path("/hello").request().header("Authorization", "Bearer " + jwt) 
            .get(String.class);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            res = "[Error]:" + e.toString();
        } finally {
            c.close();        
        }  
        pw.append("The jaxrs service response is: "+ res);
        pw.append("\n");
        pw.flush();
    
    }
    
    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {  
        doGet(request, response);
    }

    // use jwt-1.0 feature to build jwt
    private String buildJwt(String userName) throws Exception {
        JwtBuilder builder = JwtBuilder.create("myBuilder")
                .jwtId(true)
                .claim(Claims.SUBJECT, userName)
                .claim("upn", userName)
                .claim("groups","users");
               
        return builder.buildJwt().compact();      
    }
}

@ApplicationPath("/")
public class JaxrsHelloApp extends Application {}

    @GET    
    public String hello() {
      DateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss");
      Date date = new Date();     
      String principalName = request.getUserPrincipal() == null ?  "null" : request.getUserPrincipal().getName();
      return "Jax-Rs app is accessed.  The current time is: "+ dateFormat.format(date) 
         + " and the authenticated user is: "+ principalName;
    }

If you want to examine the tokens from the provider, or perhaps send the provider's JWT
downstream instead of building your own, the tokens can be accessed using the 
`com.ibm.websphere.security.social.UserProfileManager` and `com.ibm.websphere.security.social.UserProfile` APIs 
documented in the 
link:https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS7K4U_liberty/com.ibm.websphere.javadoc.liberty.doc/com.ibm.websphere.appserver.api.social_1.0-javadoc/com/ibm/websphere/security/social/UserProfileManager.html[UserProfileManager Javadoc].

This concludes our brief tour of OpenID Connect and JWT in Open Liberty.
