= Access any version of MongoDB with Open Liberty using CDI
Mark Swatosh <https://github.com/mswatosh>

Using MongoDB with Open Liberty previously meant enabling the `mongodb-2.0` feature and configuring several elements in `server.xml`, but was limited to certain versions of MongoDB. Now, with improvements in CDI and the introduction of MicroProfile Config, you can easily configure access to any version of MongoDB with a CDI producer (for an introduction to using CDI producers, see the https://openliberty.io/guides/cdi-intro.html[Injecting Dependencies into Microservices guide]). 

== A CDI producer for MongoDB
With a CDI producer, you are no longer restricted to MongoDB 2.X versions, and can easily provide a MongoDatabase to your application. This example demonstrates how to create a CDI producer to inject a MongoDatabase:

[source, java]
----
@ApplicationScoped
public class MongoProducer {
	
    @Produces
    public MongoClient createMongo() {
        return new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(), new MongoClientOptions.Builder().build());
    }

    @Produces
    public MongoDatabase createDB(MongoClient client) {
        return client.getDatabase("testdb");
    }

    public void close(@Disposes MongoClient toClose) {
        toClose.close();
    }
}
----

Here is an example of using the CDI producer to inject a MongoDatabase in a JAX-RS application:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
MongoDatabase db;

@POST
@Path("/add") 
@Consumes(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
public void add(CrewMember crewMember) {
    MongoCollection<Document> crew = db.getCollection("Crew");
    Document newCrewMember = new Document();
    newCrewMember.put("Name",crewMember.getName());
    newCrewMember.put("Rank",crewMember.getRank());
    newCrewMember.put("CrewID",crewMember.getCrewID());
    crew.insertOne(newCrewMember);
}
----

== Enhancing the CDI producer

One of the advantages of using a CDI producer is that it can be tailored to your needs. For improved security, the `createMongo` method can be enhanced to include authentication with a user name and an encoded password:

[source, java]
----
@Produces
public MongoClient createMongo() {
    String password = PasswordUtil.passwordDecode(encodedPass);
    MongoCredential creds = MongoCredential.createCredential(user, dbName, password.toCharArray());
    return new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(), creds, new MongoClientOptions.Builder().build());
}
----

This requires `passwordUtilities-1.0`, available as a Maven dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.openliberty.features</groupId>
    <artifactId>passwordUtilities-1.0</artifactId>
    <version>18.0.0.4</version>
</dependency>
----

You also need to enable the feature in `server.xml`:

[source, xml]
----
<feature>passwordUtilities-1.0</feature>
----

You can go further and enable link:https://openliberty.io/config/ssl.html[SSL], changing the `createMongo` method to look something like this:

[source, java]
----
@Produces
public MongoClient createMongo() throws SSLException {
    String password = PasswordUtil.passwordDecode(encodedPass);
    MongoCredential creds = MongoCredential.createCredential(user, dbName, password.toCharArray());
    SSLContext sslContext = JSSEHelper.getInstance().getSSLContext("defaultSSLConfig", Collections.emptyMap(), null);
    return new MongoClient(new ServerAddress(hostname, port), creds, new MongoClientOptions.Builder()
                           .sslEnabled(true)
                           .sslContext(sslContext)
                           .build());
}
----

== Configure with MicroProfile Config

Now that you have a more advanced CDI producer, it would be nice to add configurability to some of the variables, like the user and password. Using link:https://openliberty.io/guides/microprofile-config-intro.html[MicroProfile Config] makes configuring the MongoDB driver simple. You can add the following to your CDI producer to add configuration:

[source, java]
----
@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "mongo.hostname", defaultValue = "localhost")
String hostname;

@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "mongo.port", defaultValue = "27017")
int port;

@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "mongo.dbname", defaultValue = "testdb")
String dbName;

@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "mongo.user")
String user;

@Inject
@ConfigProperty(name = "mongo.pass.encoded")
String encodedPass;
----

Now, by placing the following snippet in your `microprofile-config.properties` or `server.env` file, the values for
user and encodedPass will be pulled into the MongoProducer class:

[source, text]
----
mongo.user=sampleUser
mongo.pass.encoded={aes}APtt+/vYxxPa0jE1rhmZue9wBm3JGqFK3JR4oJdSDGWM1wLr1ckvqkqKjSB2Voty8g==
----

== No need for a MongoDB feature

Previously, using MongoDB required enabling the `mongodb-2.0` feature, which was limited to certain
MongoDB 2.X versions. By using a CDI producer, any version of MongoDB can be used, with no need for a specific MongoDB feature. Even if the MongoDB Java Driver API changes, simple updates to your CDI producer will allow it to continue to work.
You should remove the `mongodb-2.0` feature from your `server.xml` when using newer versions of MongoDB with a CDI producer.

The MongoDB driver should be bundled in your application. To do this with Maven you can use a dependency:

[source, xml]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongodb</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongo-java-driver</artifactId>
    <version>X.X.X</version>
</dependency>
----

If you have multiple applications accessing MongoDB, instead of bundling the MongoDB driver,
 you can configure a shared library in your `server.xml` like this:
[source, xml]
----
<library id="MongoLib">
    <file name="${shared.resource.dir}/mongo-java-driver-3.8.0.jar" />
</library>

<webApplication location="MongoDBSample1.war">
    <classloader commonLibraryRef="MongoLib" />
</webApplication>

<webApplication location="MongoDBSample2.war">
    <classloader commonLibraryRef="MongoLib" />
</webApplication>
----

This illustrates how easy it is to create a CDI producer for MongoDB, configure it with MicroProfile Config, 
and use it to access a MongoDatabase in your application. The full sample is available on GitHub here: link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-mongodb[https://github.com/OpenLiberty/sample-mongodb]
