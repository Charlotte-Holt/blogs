[#mpreactive]
== Reactive messaging in microservices (MicroProfile Reactive Messaging)

MicroProfile Reactive Messaging provides a very easy-to-use way to send, receive, and process messages and is well-suited to writing applications that process streams of events. With MicroProfile Reactive Messaging, you annotate application beans' methods and, under the covers, Liberty converts these to http://www.reactive-streams.org/[reactive streams]-compatible publishers, subscribers and processors and connects them up to each other. It also provides a Connector API to allow your methods to be connected to external messaging systems.

To enable the feature include it in your `server.xml` feature list:

[source,xml]
----
<featureManager>
  <feature>mpReactiveMessaging-1.0</feature>
  ...
</featureManager>
----

With this feature in the Open Liberty runtime, an application CDI bean can have one of its methods annotated as being message driven. In the example below, the method processes messages from the "greetings" channel:

[source,java]
----
@Incoming("greetings")
publicCompletionStage <Void> consume(Message<String> greeting ){
   return greeting.ack();
}
----

A channel represents a stream of messages of a given type and, usually, the same topic. Channels can operate locally within the process or use message brokers to send messages between services.

For example, we could configure the consume method above to subscribe to messages from the Kafka greetings topic using a Kafka connector like so:

[source,text]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.group.id=greeting-consumer
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.bootstrap.servers=kafkabrokerhost:9092
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.key.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
----

Here, `connector` is a special property in reactive messaging which defines which connector to use. `bootstrap.servers`, `group.id`, `key.deserializer`, and `value.deserializer` are properties understood by the https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#consumerconfigs[Kafka client API]. This set of properties is the minimum that must be defined to receive messages from a Kafka topic.

The `liberty-kafka` connector operates according to the reactive messaging specification. For example the configuration above sets the `consume` method to consume messages from a Kafka topic queue. Further Kafka client properties can be set for the channel by setting properties that are picked up by the MicroProfile Config specification. For example, System properties via Open Liberty's `bootstrap.properties` file or environment variables from Open Liberty's `server.env` file. As per the reactive messaging specification the following configuration properties are passed to the Kafka client:


[source,text]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.[PROPERTY-NAME]=value1
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.[PROPERTY-NAME]=value2
----

These are passed to the Kafka Consumer factory method as:

[source,text]
----
PROPERTY-NAME=value
----

So, for example, a full set of properties to access IBM Public Cloud Event Streams could look like:

[source,text]
----
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.connector=liberty-kafka
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.group.id=greeting-consumer
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.key.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
mp.messaging.incoming.greetings.value.deserializer=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer

mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.bootstrap.servers=broker-1-eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093,broker-2-eventstreams.cloud.ibm.com:9093
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.sasl.jaas.config=org.apache.kafka.common.security.plain.PlainLoginModule required username="token" password="my-apikey";
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.sasl.mechanism=PLAIN
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.security.protocol=SASL_SSL
mp.messaging.connector.liberty-kafka.ssl.protocol=TLSv1.2
----

When using Kafka-based channels, Open Liberty Reactive Messaging 1.0 loads the Kafka client classes using the application classloader. If you are using the `liberty-kafka` connector to read or write Kafka messages, include in your application a Kafka client API jar that is compatible with your Kafka server. For example, the `/WEB-INF/lib/` folder would be a suitable place to place a Kafka client JAR when building the application's `.war` file.

[#testingdb]
== Testing database connections in Liberty apps with REST APIs

How many times have you had to write a server-side test that gets a connection just to check if your configuration is valid and your app can connect to your database? Now by using the REST API provided by the `restConnector-2.0` feature, you can validate supported elements of your configuration via REST endpoints.

To enable these REST endpoints, enable the `restConnector-2.0` feature for any server using JDBC, JCA, JMS, or Cloudant technologies; for example:

[source,xml]
----
<server>
  <featureManager>
    <feature>appSecurity-2.0</feature>
    <feature>restConnector-2.0</feature>
    <feature>jdbc-4.2</feature>
  </featureManager>
  <keyStore id="defaultKeyStore" password="Liberty"/>
  <quickStartSecurity userName="blogAdmin" userPassword="blogAdminPassword"/>
  <library id="derby">
    <file name="${server.config.dir}/derby/derby.jar"/>
  </library>
  <dataSource id="DefaultDataSource">
    <jdbcDriver libraryRef="derby"/>
    <!-- Example properties referencing an in-memory Derby Embedded database -->
    <properties.derby.embedded databaseName="memory:defaultdb" createDatabase="create" user="dbuser" password="dbpass"/>
  </dataSource>
...
</server>

[#oidc]
== Managing tokens on a Liberty Open ID Connect provider (OpenID Connect Server 1.0)

The Liberty OpenID Connect Server feature can now generate application passwords and application tokens for non-interactive (e.g. non-browser) clients to authenticate into OAuth protected resource services. The application password is an alternative password that you can use like a normal password in OAuth resource owner password grant type. The application token is a long-lived OAuth access token that is used like a normal OAuth access token.

The applications can then use them to access secured resources on servers that are configured to accept OAuth access tokens from the OpenID Connect server. The user's password is never exposed to the app, and the tokens can be revoked independently if needed. App-passwords are exchanged repetitively by the non-browser app for short-lived access tokens using a standard OAuth ROPC flow. So if an access token is ever compromised, it is not valid for long. App-tokens are long-lived access tokens.

The tokens can be administered using REST interfaces and the Admin Center.

To give it a go, create a new Liberty server and use this `server.xml`. Comments in `server.xml` explain the new configuration attributes. This server doesn't have a backing database because it is for demo purposes only.

[#encryptoauth]
== Support OAuth 2.0 client secret and access token hashing (OpenID Connect Server 1.0)

In Openid Connect Server, you can now store OAuth client secret and access token in cryptographic hash forms like password hash to mitigate data breach if database is compromised. Liberty's OpenID Connect Provider used to require database/volume encryption to protect the OAuth access token and client secrets. With this update, Liberty's OpenID Connect provider can be configured to secure both access token and client secret in the same way as the user password, and store them as password hashes based on PBKDF2WithHmacSHA512 algorithm in addition to security.

To configure the server, edit the `server.xml`

[#pkce]
== Support for PKCE in Liberty OpenID Connect providers (OpenID Connect Server 1.0)

Liberty Openid Connect Server now automatically enables the support of Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE) specification (OAuth 2.0 RFC 7636) to prevent interception of the OAuth authorization code. The Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE, pronounced pixie) is a technique for public clients to mitigate the threat of code interception. The technique allows the client first creating a secret called `code_verifier` when requesting an authorization code, and then using that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. Additionally, the secret is sent to the authorization server as a hash called the `code_challenge` when requesting an authorization code. An attacker who intercepts the authorization code is now unable to redeem it for an access token, as they are not in possession of the `code_verifier` secret.
