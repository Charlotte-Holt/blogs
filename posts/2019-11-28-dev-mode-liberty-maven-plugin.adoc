= Dev mode support in Liberty Maven Plug-in 3.1
Cheryl King <https://github.com/cherylking>

Recently we focused on simplifying the use of the Liberty Maven plug-in and improving the developer experience for Open Liberty. This post describes the various enhancements and simplifications that are available in the 3.1 release of `liberty-maven-plugin`. 

== What's new?

The biggest enhancement is the addition of a development mode, which provides, in any text editor or IDE, hot reload and deployment, on demand testing, and debugger support when you're developing applications. You can read more about dev mode in the link:https://openliberty.io/blog/2019/10/22/liberty-dev-mode.html[Open Liberty development mode blog post].

Other notable enhancements include:

* The ability to specify Liberty configuration with Maven properties
* The `run` goal now implicitly creates the server, installs features referenced by the `server.xml`, and deploys the application before starting the server in the foreground

For more details, check out the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/releases/tag/liberty-maven-3.1[3.1 release notes].

== What changed?

In order to simplify the developer experience with the Liberty Maven Plug-in, we made the following changes:

* Simplified the goal names
* Simplified the server installation to install by default the latest Open Liberty kernel from Maven Central
* Changed the precedence for the common server parameters and removed defaults for individual files
* Combined the `install-apps` and `deploy` goal functionality into a single `deploy` goal
* Changed the `looseApplication` default value to `true`
* Modified the `package` goal to support `packageName`, `packageDirectory`, and `packageType` parameters with logical defaults

For more details, check out the link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven/releases/tag/liberty-maven-3.0[3.0 release notes].

== Simplified pom.xml

With all of these changes, the `pom.xml` configuration for the `liberty-maven-plugin` can be greatly simplified. Here are a couple of examples (in versions 3.0 and above, the `groupId` of the plugin is `io.openliberty.tools`).

== Example 1

[source,xml]
--- 
<project>
    ...
    <build>
        <plugins>
            <!-- Enable liberty-maven-plugin -->
            <plugin>
                <groupId>io.openliberty.tools</groupId>
                <artifactId>liberty-maven-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>3.1</version>
            </plugin>
        </plugins>
    </build>
    ...
</project>
---

With the `pom.xml` in Example 1, you can simply run `mvn liberty:run` for your project. As a result, `liberty-maven-plugin` installs the latest Open Liberty kernel from Maven Central, creates the server, installs features referenced by the `server.xml` (which can be placed in the default location for `configDirectory` which is `src/main/liberty/config`), deploy the application, and start the server in the foreground. No further configuration is required to get started!

== Example 2

[source,xml]
--- 
<properties>
    <liberty.jvm.minHeap>-Xms512m</liberty.jvm.minHeap>
    <liberty.env.JAVA_HOME>/opt/ibm/java</liberty.env.JAVA_HOME>
    <liberty.var.someVariable1>someValue1</liberty.var.someVariable1>
    <liberty.defaultVar.someDefaultVar1>someDefaultValue1</liberty.defaultVar.someDefaultVar1>
</properties>
---

Example 2 shows how to use Maven properties in the `pom.xml` to specify Liberty configuration. The properties can also be overridden on the command line using `-D<maven property name>`. This provides an easy way to test with different server configurations.

So give the 3.1 version of the `liberty-maven-plugin` a try and let us know what you think! Tap us up on link:https://gitter.im/OpenLiberty/developer-experience[Gitter], or file issues and send us pull requests on link:https://github.com/OpenLiberty/ci.maven[GitHub].
